## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- Helping Boom Bikes attain their business goals i.e increasing the number of bike rentals by helping them invest in the right paradigm by utilizing Machine Learning
- Our business proble as stated earlier is to guide boom bikes in the right direction and explain the trend they will most likely obesreve post pandemic including when and where they can invest so that they can garner more profits
- The dataset used for this analysis and modelling is day.csv

## Conclusions
- BoomBikes already had a market for Bike rental which is explained by "const" which is 0.2999477  which is great for the company, so they can expect growth despite little investment, the reason for this trend could be that people are trying to reduce their carbon footprint and were encouraged to rather cycle; but there are sevral other factors as well like having fun, riding bikes to school, mountain biking wheere in most cases people tend to rent theri bikes because it porves to be cheapre to them cause they dont have to incur transport charges along with other miscellaneous charges with comes along you can refer the article below which goes along with our timeline: https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2020/07/13/amidst-cycling-surge-sport-of-mountain-biking-seeing-increased-sales-trail-usage/?sh=2c8fcbae3ddf


-  Boom bikes should expand their businesses in the month of September  as it shows the highest level of bikes rented

- Boom Bike should also see that they hand out lucrative offers when the weather conditions are Ideal and temperatures slightly on the higher end cause according to the data and model this will yield maximum rental bookings, the model also concludes that  BoomBikes should also focus more offers and equipments during winters as it may help drive the rental up in those months.

- From the EDA it was clear that the Fall, summer and winter had comparitively higher rental bookings, so Boom bikes must consider investing in its offers and promotion during these seasons and the months falling in these seasons.

- Last but not the least BoomBikes should increase their investments every year as we can saw that the company has the potential to grow maybe not in the pandemics as people were advised to  quarantine themselves but post covid where people are more likely and eager to enjoy the outdoors and rides, the company can see a tremendous growth coupled with the scenarios above they can successfully attract more customers.
